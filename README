# Bill-Upload Analyzer

Upload a PDF/JPG/PNG utility bill → AI extracts key fields → returns a personalized community-solar savings estimate and downloadable PDF summary. Front-end is a static React SPA deployed via GitHub Pages; backend is a single Azure Function.

## Quick start
```bash
npm install     # install deps
npm run dev     # local Vite dev server
npm run build   # production build to /dist
npm run preview # preview production build
```

This repo currently provides a minimal starter page built with Vite, React and Tailwind. The upload workflow and Azure integration will come in later iterations.
