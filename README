# Bill-Upload Analyzer

Upload a PDF/JPG/PNG utility bill → AI extracts key fields → returns a personalized community-solar savings estimate and downloadable PDF summary. Front-end is a static React SPA deployed via GitHub Pages; backend is a single Azure Function.

## Quick start
```bash
npm install     # install deps
npm run dev     # local Vite dev server
npm run build   # production build to /dist
npm run preview # preview production build
```

This repo currently provides a minimal starter page built with Vite, React and Tailwind. The upload workflow and Azure integration will come in later iterations.

## Codespace

You can also run the dev server in a GitHub Codespace. Create a new Codespace
from the repo’s **Code** dropdown. The included `.devcontainer` config installs
dependencies automatically. Once the container is ready, start the server:

```bash
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0
```

The port `5173` is forwarded so you can preview the page in the Codespace
browser tab.
